# JXL Conversion Experimental Branch - Progress Report

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Extension Framework Updates
- Updated manifest.json to experimental version (1.1.0-experimental)
- Added experimental naming: "Image Hover Save (JXL Experimental)"
- Enhanced description to mention JXL conversion support

### 2. JXL Converter Infrastructure
- Created `jxl-converter.js` with complete framework for JXL conversion
- Implemented placeholder for @jsquash/jxl integration
- Added utility functions for filename generation and format checking
- Included browser JXL support detection capability

### 3. User Interface Enhancements
- Added JXL conversion option to download modes in popup UI
- New radio button: "ðŸ†• Convert JPEG to JXL (lossless)"
- Updated download mode indicators to include JXL conversion
- Added experimental styling for JXL mode

### 4. Background Script Integration
- Added `download_image_as_jxl` message handler
- Implemented `downloadImageAsJXL()` function with fallback logic
- Currently falls back to normal download pending @jsquash/jxl integration
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 5. Content Script Support
- Added JXL download mode detection in content script
- JPEG format validation before attempting JXL conversion
- Automatic fallback to normal download for non-JPEG images
- Lossless conversion option enabled by default

### 6. Developer Experience
- Comprehensive debug logging throughout all components
- Clear separation between framework and actual conversion logic
- Graceful degradation when JXL conversion is not available

## ðŸ”„ Current Status
The framework is **complete and functional** with one important note:
- **JXL conversion currently falls back to normal download**
- All UI elements and code paths are in place
- Ready for @jsquash/jxl library integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. @jsquash/jxl Library Integration
```bash
# Download the actual working @jsquash/jxl files
curl -o extension/jsquash-jxl.min.js [CORRECT_CDN_URL]
```

### 2. Complete JXL Converter Implementation
Update `jxl-converter.js` to:
- Import and initialize @jsquash/jxl encoder
- Implement actual `convertToJXL()` function using `encode({ lossless: true })`
- Add proper ImageData/ArrayBuffer handling
- Test with real JPEG images

### 3. Background Script Integration
Update `downloadImageAsJXL()` in `background.js`:
- Remove placeholder fallback logic
- Add actual JXL conversion call
- Handle conversion errors gracefully
- Implement proper blob URL generation for JXL files

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Test with various JPEG images
- Verify lossless conversion quality
- Test file size comparisons (JXL vs JPEG)
- Validate download functionality across different websites

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

### Lossless Conversion Configuration
As discussed with the @jsquash project author, use:
```javascript
const jxlData = await encode(imageData, { lossless: true });
```

### File Format Support
- Currently targets JPEG images only (as requested)
- Framework supports adding other formats in the future
- Automatic fallback for unsupported formats

### Performance Considerations
- JXL conversion happens in background script to avoid blocking UI
- Large images may take time to convert - progress indication may be needed
- Consider adding conversion timeout handling

## ðŸ”§ Development Environment
- Branch: `experimental/jxl-conversion`
- Base version: 1.1.0-experimental
- Backward compatible with main branch functionality
- All existing features remain fully functional

The experimental branch is ready for the final @jsquash/jxl integration step to enable actual JXL conversion functionality.
